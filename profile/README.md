# Armada

Armada is an open-source container orchestration tool that allows administrators
to automate the configuration and deployment of development environments in the
cloud.

Each development environment within Armada exists as a set of containers that
exposes an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and all its necessary
dependencies to developers via their browsers. Armada’s architecture is
self-hosted on an administrator’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and is
entirely managed from a dashboard in the browser.
